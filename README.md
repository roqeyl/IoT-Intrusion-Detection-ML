# IoT-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning

This project is my Final Year Project (FYP), focusing on building an efficient IoT-based intrusion detection system.  
I implemented **Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet**, enhanced with **War Strategy Optimization Algorithm (WSOA)** for feature selection.  

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, outlier treatment)
- Feature selection using WSOA
- Machine learning model training (RF, XGBoost, TabNet)
- Comprehensive testing with metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - False Positive Rate (FPR)
  - Detection Time per sample
- Statistical significance testing (Cohenâ€™s d, p-values)

## ðŸ“Š Datasets
- [CIC-IoT-DIAD 2024](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iot-diad-2024.html) (general IoT)
- [CICIoMT2024](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iomt2024.html) (healthcare IoT)
